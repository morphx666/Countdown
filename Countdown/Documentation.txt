The input string must be of the form:
TARGET:{VALUE};SOURCE:{LIST OF AT LEAST TWO REAL NUMBERS SEPARATED BY COMMAS}; [/sp] [/all] [/p:n] [/w] [/e] [/sv]

For example, these are valid input strings:
TARGET:104;SOURCE:100,3,4,7,1,2;
TARGET:5;SOURCE:1,2,3,5;

TARGET:10;SOURCE:1,1,5,8;
Will produce the following result: (8/(1-(1/5))) == 10

 === Parameters ===

/sp  - Display the program's progress:
       countdown TARGET:104;SOURCE:100,3,4,7,1,2; /sp

/all - Have the program find all possible solutions:
       countdown TARGET:104;SOURCE:100,3,4,7,1,2; /all

/p   - Set the desired precision.
       For example, setting /p:3 will set the maximum precision to the thousands of a decimal (0.0001):
       countdown TARGET:50.5;SOURCE:1,2,3,4,5,6.2,7; /p:3

       The default precision is automatically set to decimal places specified in the TARGET parameter.
       Using /p:0 will exclude all non exact results.

       A result displayed with the == symbol will indicate an exact match while ~= will indicate
       an approximate match, based on the set precision.

/w   - Pause the output whenever a solution is found.

/e   - Ignore errors such as divisions by zero and overflows.

/sv  - Show a step by step evaluation of every solution.
